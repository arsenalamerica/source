# [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky)

`husky` is a tool that makes implementing git hooks much easier within our
repository. We can think of git hooks as lifecycle events within Git. These
lifecycle events get triggered at different times, and we can use these events
to orchestrate other things within our repository like running lint only on
changed files, etc.
